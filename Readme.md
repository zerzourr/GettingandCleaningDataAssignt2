This document describes the processing of a raw dataset ollected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>   
The different steps to collect, and clean the data set are d√©tailed. 
The raw data for this  project are available at the following adresse  as well as the readme file and the Codebook.

##Load car and dplyr library

```r
library(car)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
```

#1. Merging of the the training and the test sets to create one data set

##Load X_train.txt and X_test.txt which are Training and Testing dataset respectively

```r
Xtrain<-read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")
Xtest<-read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
```

##Merge training and testing datasets

```r
datasetmerged=rbind(Xtrain,Xtest)
```

##Load Y_train.txt and Y_test.txt which are Training and Testing labels

```r
Ytrain<-read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt")
Ytest<-read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt")
```

##Merge training and testing labels

```r
labelsmerged<-rbind(Ytrain,Ytest)
```

##Recode Labels numbers to descriptives names

```r
Activity<-recode(labelsmerged[,1],"1='WALKING';2='WALKING_UPSTAIRS';3='WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS';4='SITTING';5='STANDING';6='LAYING'")
```

# 2.Extraction of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

##get the colomn number containing the word mean in features.txt

```r
features<-read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")
regexformean<-grep("(mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)|mean\\(\\)-|std\\(\\)-)", features[,2], ignore.case = T)
```

##Extration of measurement on mean and standard deviation

```r
dataextract<-datasetmerged[,regexformean]
```

#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

##Merge the activity descriptive name with dataextraxt

```r
dataextract<-cbind(Activity,dataextract)
```

#4. labels the data set with descriptive variable names

##Get dataset column names and add activity at the begining of the vector

```r
varnames<-grep("(mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)|mean\\(\\)-|std\\(\\)-)", features[,2], ignore.case = T,value = "TRUE")
varnames<-c("Subject", "Activity",varnames)
```

#5. creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

##Load Y_train.txt and Y_test.txt which are Training and Testing labels

```r
trainsubject<-read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")

testsubject<-read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
```

##Merge training and testing subject data

```r
subject<-rbind(trainsubject,testsubject)
colnames(subject)="Subject"
```

##Add subject to the data set

```r
dataextract<-cbind(subject,dataextract)
```

##Labels data set with descriptive data names collected in varnames

```r
colnames(dataextract)<-varnames
```

##Create Tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

##Get variable names for mean and standard deviation vairables from dataset 

```r
varnames<-grep("(mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)|mean\\(\\)-|std\\(\\)-)", features[,2], ignore.case = T,value = "TRUE")
```

## Melt data extraction

```r
tidydataset <- melt(dataextract, id=c("Subject","Activity"), measure.vars=varnames)
```

##Cast Melted dataset to obtain average for each varaiable for each activity and each subject

```r
casttidydataset <- dcast(tidydataset,Subject+Activity~variable,mean)
```

##Save tidy data set as tidydataset.txt file

```r
write.table(casttidydataset, "tidydataset.txt",row.names =FALSE)
```
